Weapons,2025,4.0,"Julia Garner was incredible as the lead, honestly didn't expect her to carry a horror film this well but she completely nailed it. The pacing kept me hooked the whole time, though Alex's storyline dragged a bit in the middle but I get why they needed that extra time with his character.First half had me genuinely scared with some really solid jumpscares and this creepy atmosphere that just builds and builds. Then it shifts into this mystery thing that‚Ä¶",2025-08-20,0,/film/weapons-2025/
